### Hi there! 👋
I am Satin Wuker, the founder of the Rickroll programming language; <br>
an amateur dev who devotes himself to compiler & interpreter development, and web scrapers. <br>
🔎 Currently learning deep learning, mainly CNN, RNN, LSTM, and Transformer! <br>
🛠️ Still tuning parameters of the cancer classification model... <br>
🚀 Ultimate goals:
1. Publish a paper about the **large generative pre-trained transformer-based music harmony generation model**
2. Get into UC Berkeley for the computer science major
3. Make [Rickroll-lang](https://github.com/Rick-Lang/rickroll-lang) great again

not updating that usually bc of school;-; <br>
but will still try to put my effort into learning cutting-edge technology and publishing useful and outstanding projects!
