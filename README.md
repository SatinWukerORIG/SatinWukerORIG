### Hi there! üëã
I am Satin Wuker, the founder of the Rickroll programming language; <br>
an amateur dev who devotes himself to compiler & interpreter development, and web scrapers. <br>
üîé Currently learning deep learning, mainly CNN, RNN, LSTM, and Transformer! <br>
üõ†Ô∏è Still tuning parameters of the cancer classification model... <br>
üöÄ Goals:
1. Learn more, do more, code more, think more.
2. Get into UC Berkeley for the computer science major
3. Make [Rickroll-lang](https://github.com/Rick-Lang/rickroll-lang) great again

not updating that usually bc of school;-; <br>
but will still try to put my effort into learning cutting-edge technology and publishing useful and outstanding projects!
