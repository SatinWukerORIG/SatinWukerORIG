### Hi there! 👋
I am Satin Wuker, the founder of the Rickroll programming language; <br>
an amateur dev who devotes himself in compiler & interpreter development, and web scrapers. <br>
🔎 Currently learning deep learning, mainly CNN, RNN, LSTM, and Transformer! <br>
🛠️ Still tuning parameters of the cancer classification model... <br>
🚀 Ultimate goals:
1. Publish a paper on arxiv about the **large generative pre-trained transformer-based music harmony generation model**
2. Get into UC Berkeley for computer science major
3. Find a friend (female) who knows how to code <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/20/3b/c2/203bc22442df63b3a82e7d4079f52403.jpg" width="25" height="25"> <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/20/3b/c2/203bc22442df63b3a82e7d4079f52403.jpg" width="25" height="25">

not updating that usually bc of school;-; <br>
but will still try to put my effort in learning cutting edge technology and publish useful and outstanding projects!
